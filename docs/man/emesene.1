.TH EMESENE 1  "March 1, 2011"
.SH NAME
emesene \- an instant messaging client
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B emesene 2
tries to be a simple but feature complete program that allows one to chat
using MSN and Jabber based networks.
.sp
From its roots emesene 2 provides a UI that is easy to use by users coming
from Windows Live Messanger but doing special focus on consistency and
simplicity.
.sp
Support for Jabber based networks through the use of different backends is
provided but without removing features from the main protocol.
.sp
Since emesene 2 is a single protocol/account client you will have to start more
than one instance to use more than one account, if you think this is a problem
we recommend clients like pidgin, empathy or kopete that are built to handle
multiple accounts.
